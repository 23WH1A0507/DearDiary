## Getting Started

We are happy to have you contribute to our project! Follow these steps to set up your local environment and start making contributions.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

To get started, you will need:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later) installed.
- **Git** for cloning and version control.
- **Clerk Account** for authentication (you will need API keys).

### Cloning the Repository

First, fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top. Then, clone your forked copy to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DearDiary.git
```

### To navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DearDiary
```

### Installing Dependencies
To install all required dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install

```

This command will install Next.js, Clerk, and other necessary libraries.

Setting Up Clerk

* Sign Up for Clerk: If you haven’t already, sign up at [Clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev/) and create an application.

* Get API Keys: Once your application is set up, get your Frontend API Key and Secret Key.

* Add Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<YOUR_FRONTEND_API_KEY>
CLERK_API_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

Verify Configuration: Double-check that the keys are correctly set up by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000 and see Clerk authentication enabled.


### Running the Project

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Your local server will be running at http://localhost:3000.
